openresolv is a resolvconf implementation which manages resolv.conf
You can find the latest version at http://roy.marples.name/projects/openresolv
It is written and maintained by Roy Marples <roy@marples.name>

This resolvconf implementation, along with its subscribers, work with a
POSIX compliant shell and userland utilities. It is designed to work without
tools such as sed as it *has* to work without /usr being available.

On systems where resolvconf is expected to be used before /var/run is available
for writing, you can configure openresolv to write somewhere else, like say a
ramdisk.
