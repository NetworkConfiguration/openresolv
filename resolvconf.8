.SH DESCRIPTION
Overwrite (\fB\-a\fR) or delete (\fB\-d\fR) the nameserver information
record for network interface \fIINTERFACE\fR
and run the update scripts in \fI/etc/resolvconf/update.d/\fR.
.PP
With \fB\-u\fR, just run the update scripts.
.PP
With \fB\-l\fR, list the resolv files for each interface, optionally
with patterns to match interface names.
.PP
With \fB\-i\fR, list the interfaces we have resolv files for, optionally
with patterns to match interface names.
.PP
With \fB\-v\fR, we echo variables NEWDOMAIN, NEWSEARCH and NEWNS to the
console which can be used to make it easer writing scripts which configure
DNS resolvers.
.SH SERVERS
Normally
.B resolvconf
is run only by hook scripts attached to network interface configurers
such as
.BR pppd (8) 
(for ppp interfaces),
to DHCP clients such as
.BR dhclient (8),
to
.BR /etc/init.d/net.eth0 
and
.BR openvpn ,
and
to DNS caches such as
.BR dnsmasq (8)
(for the loopback interface).
However, the administrator can also run
.B resolvconf
from the command line to add or delete auxiliary nameserver information.
.SH CLIENTS
Nameserver information provided to
.B resolvconf
is stored for use by subscribers to \fBresolvconf\fR's notification service.
Subscribers that need to know when nameserver information has changed
should install a script in \fI/etc/resolvconf/update.d/\fR
(... or in \fI/etc/resolvconf/update-libc.d/\fR: see below).
For example, DNS caches such as
.BR dnsmasq (8)
and
.BR pdnsd (8)
subscribe to the notification service so that they know
whither to forward queries.
.PP
The most important piece of
software that subscribes to the notification service is the set of functions
that make up the GNU C Library
.BR resolver (3).
When nameserver information is updated the script
\fI/etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc\fR writes a new resolver configuration
file to \fI/etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf\fR and then runs the scripts in
/etc/resolvconf/update-libc.d/.
To make the resolver use the dynamically generated resolver configuration
file the administrator should ensure that \fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR is a symbolic
link to \fIresolvconf/run/resolv.conf\fR.
This link is never modified by \fB/sbin/resolvconf\fR.
If you find that \fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR is not being updated,
check to see that the link is intact.
.PP
The GNU C Library resolver library isn't the only resolver library available.
However, any resolver library that reads /etc/resolv.conf
(and most of them do, in order to be compatible with the GNU C Library resolver)
should work with
.BR resolvconf .
.PP
Subscribers that need to know only when the resolver configuration file
has changed should install a script in \fI/etc/resolvconf/update-libc.d/\fR
rather than in \fI/etc/resolvconf/update.d/\fR.
(This is important for synchronization purposes:
scripts in \fIupdate-libc.d/\fR are run after resolv.conf has been updated;
the same is not necessarily true of scripts in update.d/.)
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-a\fR \fIINTERFACE\fR
Add or overwrite the record for network interface \fIINTERFACE\fR.
When this option is used the information must be provided to
.B resolvconf
on its standard input in the format of the
.BR resolv.conf (5)
file.
Each line in the file must be terminated by a newline.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fIINTERFACE\fR
Delete the record for network interface \fIINTERFACE\fR.
.PP
The \fIINTERFACE\fR name may not contain spaces, slashes, asterisks or
initial dots, hyphens or tildes.
.PP
Following the addition or deletion of the record, resolvconf runs
the update scripts as described in the CLIENTS section.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
Just run the update scripts.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fIPATTERN\fR
List the resolv.conf files for the interfaces that match the pattern,
otherwise all the interfaces.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fIPATTERN\fR
List the interfaces that match the pattern otherwise all the interfaces.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fIPATTERN\fR
Echo variables NEWDOMAIN, NEWSEARCH and NEWNS to the console.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/resolvconf/run
This is either a directory where nameserver information can be stored
or a symbolic link to such a directory.
Clients should not make any assumptions about the canonical location
of this directory or the hierarchy that is constructed under it.
.TP
.I /etc/resolvconf/interface-order
Determines the order in which nameserver information records are processed
by resolvconf -l.
.TP
.I /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base
File containing basic resolver information.
The lines in this file are included in the resolver configuration file
even when no interfaces are configured.
.TP
.I /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head
File to be prepended to the dynamically generated resolver configuration file.
Normally this is just a comment line.
.TP
.I /etc/resolvconf/reslov.conf.d/tail
File to be appended to the dynamically generated resolver configuration file.
To append nothing, make this an empty file.
.SH BUGS
Currently
.B resolvconf
does not check the sanity of the information provided to it.
